# Notes

The paper proposed a tree-like reasoning (but different from CoT) structure to guide RAG reasoning. I think this already solved by the feedback-reflection process, which avoids broken logics.

This paper can be unhelpful.

> [!Abstract]
> The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant knowledge to broaden their knowledge boundaries and mitigate factual hallucinations stemming from knowledge gaps. However, the RAG Framework faces challenges in effective knowledge retrieval and utilization; invalid or misused knowledge will interfere with LLM generation, reducing reasoning efficiency and answer quality. Existing RAG methods address these issues by decomposing and expanding queries, introducing special knowledge structures, and using reasoning process evaluation and feedback. However, the linear reasoning structures limit complex thought transformations and reasoning based on intricate queries. Additionally, knowledge retrieval and utilization are decoupled from reasoning and answer generation, hindering effective knowledge support during answer generation. To address these limitations, we propose the CRP-RAG framework, which employs reasoning graphs to model complex query reasoning processes more comprehensively and accurately. CRP-RAG guides knowledge retrieval, aggregation, and evaluation through reasoning graphs, dynamically adjusting the reasoning path based on evaluation results and selecting knowledge-sufficiency paths for answer generation. CRP-RAG outperforms the best LLM and RAG baselines by 2.46 in open-domain QA, 7.43 in multi-hop reasoning, and 4.2 in factual verification. Experiments also show the superior factual consistency and robustness of CRP-RAG over existing RAG methods. Extensive analyses confirm its accurate and fact-faithful reasoning and answer generation for complex queries.
