> [!Abstract]
> We introduce S2ORC, a large corpus of 81.1M English-language academic papers spanning many academic disciplines. The corpus consists of rich metadata, paper abstracts, resolved bibliographic references, as well as structured full text for 8.1M open access papers. Full text is annotated with automatically-detected inline mentions of citations, figures, and tables, each linked to their corresponding paper objects. In S2ORC, we aggregate papers from hundreds of academic publishers and digital archives into a unified source, and create the largest publicly-available collection of machine-readable academic text to date. We hope this resource will facilitate research and development of tools and tasks for text mining over academic text.

> ng S2ORC is:  1) Process PDFs and LATEX sources to derive metadata, clean full text, inline citations and references, and bibliography entries, 2) Select the best metadata and full text parses for each paper cluster, 3) Filter paper clusters with insufficient metadata or content, and 4) Resolve bibliography links between paper clusters in the corpus.
